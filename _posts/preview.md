title: "Kickstarting My Summer: Journey as a Headstarter AI Software Engineer Fellow"
excerpt: "building a passion for things you enjoy when it comes to future career goals has to start somewhere, and for me it all started by taking action on pursuing my degree in computer science growing an unexpected interest in programming. Through every class I've been in, to learning as much as I can to be a successful software engineer, prioritizing industry experience was my next step to my accomplishing my career goals. Starting a fellowship with Headstarter AI was that milestone to my journey, and I will tell you why."

## What is Headstarter AI and What grabbed my Attention?

Headstarter AI is a training development program open to all aspiring software engineers wanting to gain experience and build a career in technology. They prioritize consistent training in a series of projects weekly, hosted hackathons with other fellows in the program every weekend, attend networking events hosted by the creator of Headstarter AI, Yasin Ehsan, and motivated contributors to the program to really share how valuable and meaningful this fellowship really is, have provided resume and interview training assistance, and most importantly, build a team contributing project that entails impactful requirements and results that puts together what you learned.


## What I've Done So Far

During my time as a Software Engineering Fellow so far has been such an adventure so far! From getting accepted into the fellowship, joining a discord server that allows us the full reign of networking opportunities to really getting things started with project building and training. I've got to network with people from all around the world like Africa, India, Toronto, and local cities in my neck of the woods like Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio! The funniest part was building my project team for my big project which was "Take a startupâ€™s current backlog and build it meeting business requirements!", so it gives us a taste of some industry software development. Getting to know people's skills and experiene was eye opening knowing how they started and their end goals especially knowing we all can contribute to our projects. 

For project prep and work done, tasks were to start meeting up with our teams to get ready for the coming weeks of team projects which will be week to week like sprints, and for our very first one is building an "AI Customer Support" application with OpenAI, Next.js, and AWS services. As for my first completed projected I was able to improve on my personal portfolio and create page that's with a more modern and sleek appeal for user experience and getting to know me as an aspiring software engineer, and more will come!
