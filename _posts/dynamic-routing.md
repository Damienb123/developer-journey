You can imagine Foodie being exactly what you expect, another InstaCart or Amazon Web Store, in the same intentions we want to develop a fast and easy way to fulfill your shopping needs, but with an inventory that doesn't speak "Oh I can just order from this other site cheaper!" or "There's not enough selection!", and preventing an unsuccessful user experience, our goal prioritize user concerns and needs to make user's feel satified with every purchase. 

## Whats under the Hood?

With a team of four developers, we were able to tackle our responsive application from all sides, to front-end, back-end, and database management. Starting off, the front-end was prioritized with the best practices of UX Design principles gathering inspiration and a starting point for our landing that we can grow from. A selection of appealing colors to allow people to feel welcome grocery shopping was needed with soft and energetic intention. developing the front-end, we used React.js, a front-end framework with TailWind CSS and DaisyUI components with smooth and efficient project production. A series of carousels item cards to add to your shopping cart, yet some cards were used to present trending items on sale in our store. We designed a way to view an item listing page of kinds of items with no limitations, and once you're ready to pay, you can apply any discount codes available by us!

As we designed the front-end, we push heavily to make sure our web application is functional when moving from page to page, modifying items from quanity to removing, a history of your orders made, and modifying user accounts currently active using the site. This part of the project was developed with Python and FastAPI for smooth and efficient functionality with the incorporation of the front-end. Our back-end team decided to move towards a MariaDB and AWS ec2, S3, and RDS approach for application functionality and management.
