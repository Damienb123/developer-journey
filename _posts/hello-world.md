title: "Simulate a Map Navigator Using Dijkstra's Algorithm"
excerpt: "Have you ever wondered how Google Maps efficiently finds the shortest route between metro stations? Our latest project, Map Navigator, simulates this very process, providing a robust tool for computing the shortest paths in a metro network using Dijkstra's algorithm. This powerful algorithm calculates the minimum distance from a starting station to all other stations in the network, ensuring you get the quickest route every time."

## Shortest Path Calculation and Graph Representation

Map Navigator computes the shortest paths from a specified source station to every other station in the network. Whether you're commuting to work or exploring a new city, this feature ensures you always know the fastest way to your destination. The metro network is represented using an adjacency matrix, with stations as nodes and the distances between them as edges. This representation is crucial for visualizing and computing paths efficiently.

## The Efficient Algorithm

Implemented using Dijkstra's Algorithm, Map Navigator guarantees optimal pathfinding in graphs with non-negative weights. The algorithm's efficiency is enhanced with a priority queue, achieving a time complexity of O(V2)O(V2) for an adjacency matrix and O(Elog‚Å°V)O(ElogV) for a min-heap.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install and run the Map Navigator project using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Map-Navigator-Dijkstras-Algorithm.git
cd Map-Navigator-Dijkstras-Algorithm

```

2. Compile the Program: 
Use the GCC compiler to compile the program by running:

```
gcc -o Map-Navigator-Dijkstras-Algorithm main.c

```

3. Run the Program: 
Execute the compiled program with the following command:

```
./Map-Navigator-Dijkstras-Algorithm

```

## What is the Outcome of this Project?

The program initializes a graph representing the metro network and computes the shortest paths from a specified source station to all other stations using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The output displays the shortest distances from the source to each station.
